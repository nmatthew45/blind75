What is Object Oriented Programming?
- Object Oriented Programming is a computer programming model that organizes code into classes and objects.

What is a class?
- A class is a user defined datatype that will act as the blueprint for its objects. It describes the attributes and
methods that objects created from it will have

What is an object?
- An object is an instance of a class. An object has attributes defined in its class. It also has methods defined in
its class that it can use.

What is a method?
- A method is a function defined inside of a class that describes the behaviors of an object.

OOP is based off of 4 main principles

1. Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is the principle which states that all important information pertaining to an object and how it works
is bundled inside of a class.
    - reduce complexity

2. Abstraction
- Abstraction is when the programmer hides irrelevant data about an object to the user to reduce complexity and help
simplify object interaction.
    - reduce complexity

3. Inheritance
- Inheritance is when classes reuse code from other classes. A hierarchy between classes can be maintained and relevant
code can be reused.
    - eliminate redundant code

4. Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is when an object's behavior changes depending on the class's implementation
    - eliminate redundant code
